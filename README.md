Automation Using ServiceNow widget/Catalog form and IntegrationHub:
 
 Traceroute data will be gathered through a user input form.
 ServiceNow Portal widgets will parse the output to extract each IP hop. These IP addresses will be sent to the Edge Orchestrator via IntegrationHub to obtain location and hostname information. (Static Locations for MVP)
 The collected results will be displayed visually on a map using the ServiceNow Geo Mapping API.
